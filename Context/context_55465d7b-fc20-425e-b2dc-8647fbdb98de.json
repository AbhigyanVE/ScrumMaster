    "response": "Here's the list of team members currently associated with the project 'AEOW':\n\n- Mohit Kumar\n- Praveen Soni\n- Unassigned\n- Sonia\n\nSummary: There are a total of 4 entries for team members, although one entry is marked as 'Unassigned.' This suggests that some tasks may not have a specific owner yet, which could potentially impact the project timeline and accountability.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. **Assign Unassigned Tasks**: Review the tasks that are currently unassigned and find suitable team members to take ownership. This will ensure that no task is overlooked and can help in maintaining a steady workflow.\n   \n2. **Team Capacity Review**: Evaluate the current workload of Mohit Kumar, Praveen Soni, and Sonia to ensure that assigning additional tasks will not overwhelm them.\n\n3. **Role Clarity and Responsibilities**: Ensure that each team member has clarity about their role in the project. This can be achieved through a team meeting or individual check-ins to confirm understanding and alignment on project goals.\n\nConcerns to Address:\n- The presence of unassigned tasks could signal a need for better task distribution and resource allocation. Addressing this proactively can prevent bottlenecks and ensure smooth sprint execution.",
