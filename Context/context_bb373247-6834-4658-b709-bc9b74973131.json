This might not align with typical sprint or release planning timelines unless this task is part of a long-term project.\n\n2. **No Time Estimate**: The task currently has a time estimate of 0 hours, which could imply that the effort required has not been evaluated or recorded yet.\n\n3. **Status in \"To Do\"**: The task is still in the \"To Do\" status, indicating that it hasn't been initiated yet, which is expected considering the distant due date.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Clarify the Deadline**: Confirm with the project stakeholders or product owner whether the December 17, 2025, due date is intentional and aligns with project goals. If it's meant to be sooner, the date should be adjusted to reflect a realistic timeline.\n\n2. **Estimate Effort**: Work with Koyel Ghosh or the relevant team members to provide a realistic time estimate for this task. This will help in better sprint and resource planning.\n\n3. **Provide Task Details**: Encourage the assignee to add a description to the task. This will ensure clarity on the task requirements and help in assessing the necessary steps for completion.\n\n### Concerns or Blockers\n\n- **Lack of Description**: The absence of a description could lead to misunderstandings about what this task entails. This should be addressed to avoid any confusion or misalignment with objectives.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can ensure that task AFSP-94 is appropriately planned and aligns with project objectives.
