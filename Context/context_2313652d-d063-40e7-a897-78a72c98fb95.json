Encourage team members to bring up any issues hindering their tasks.\n\n3. **Assignee Check-ins**: Conduct direct check-ins with team members who have multiple stuck items, such as Abhishek Sharma and Praveen Soni, to understand specific challenges and offer targeted support.\n\n4. **Priority Reassessment**: Given many high-priority items are stuck, reassess these priorities to ensure resources are adequately allocated to address the most critical tasks.\n\n#### Concerns:\n- The prolonged period without updates suggests a potential communication breakdown that needs addressing.\n- If not resolved, these delays may lead to knock-on effects on project timelines and outputs.\n\nBy",

Immediate intervention is recommended to prevent long-term productivity issues.\n\nBy addressing these points, the team can optimize productivity and maintain a healthier work environment.",
