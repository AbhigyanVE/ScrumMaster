    "response": "Based on the query results for issue AFSP-95, it appears that there is no deadline currently set for this issue, as the `duedate` is showing as `None`.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Having no deadline set for AFSP-95 might indicate that the task lacks a clear time frame for completion, which could potentially impact planning and prioritization.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Clarify Priority:** Engage with the product owner or relevant stakeholders to determine the priority of AFSP-95. If it's a high-priority issue, setting a due date should be expedited.\n   \n2. **Set a Due Date:** Once the priority is clarified, collaborate with the team to establish a realistic due date based on current workload and capacity. This will aid in better sprint planning and resource allocation.\n   \n3. **Review Backlog Management:** It's beneficial to review backlog management practices to ensure that all issues, especially critical ones, have due dates assigned to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\n\n**Concerns to Address:**\n- Without a deadline, there's a risk of the task slipping through the cracks, especially if it's not regularly revisited during sprint planning sessions.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can ensure that AFSP-95 is effectively managed and integrated into upcoming sprints with clear expectations and timelines.",
