## CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE

If any change in LLM Response is to be found, 
> for example: in the previous versions, when "It was asked about the Health of a Project", the response was there, but now, when the same question was being asked, then it gives an "ERROR"
For these kind of **DISCREPANCIES** please check the **IMPORTANT RULES** section of the LLM present in `app.py` *(present in lines 432 in v2.2)*
